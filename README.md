# Codebook
Interactive notebooks made simple! For everyone who want's to document, share or present code!
The goal of this project is to make notebooks fun, usefull and easy to share.
You will be able to work on codebooks in an easy web-based UI. You can work on it with other people and share presentations of it.
For the first version this will only work for javascript, but it should definitely be possible to use other languages like python or ruby as well.

## Project status
I just started to work on this project, so please feel free to help if it sounds interesting to you!
Later in this readmy, you can find a roadmap for the first fiew versions, as well as some other ideas.

## Motivation
If you ever used Jupyter notebooks you know that they are just awesome! But I also see some major disadvantages in them:
- It's not online (JupyterHub is only somewhat a solution to this)
- The notebooks are not easy to versionize
- You can send the notebook around, but then your colleagues and your boss need to run it, install packages and... urgh)
- It's not nice to present.

## Roadmap / Tasks
### Version 0.1.0
- [ ] Create a minimal client/UI (web based and online!)
- [ ] Implement the backend
  - [ ] code execution
  - [ ] UI connection (websockets?)
- [ ] Define how codebooks can be exported, imported and saved (json?)
